## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of **8,000 bilateral negotiations** between LLM agents in a classical newsvendor framework. The experiment systematically examined the impact of reflection mechanisms, model size effects, role asymmetry, and individual model personalities on negotiation outcomes.

### Key Findings

1. **Reflection Effects:** SIGNIFICANT (p = 0.000, η² = 0.008)
2. **Model Size Impact:** SIGNIFICANT (p = 0.000, η² = 0.002)
3. **Buyer Advantage:** $13.79 systematic advantage (Small effect (d = 0.422))
4. **Model Personalities:** Maximum role delta of $14.61 between buyer/supplier roles

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Descriptive Statistics

- **Total Negotiations:** 8,000
- **Completion Rate:** 100.0%
- **Mean Negotiated Price:** $51.21
- **Optimal Price:** $65
- **Distance from Optimal:** $17.18
- **Buyer Advantage:** $13.79

### 2. Research Question 1: Reflection Effects

**Statistical Test:** F(21.257) = 21.257, p = 0.000, η² = 0.008

**Finding:** Reflection had a statistically significant effect on negotiation outcomes.

| Pattern | Description | N | Success Rate | Mean Price | Buyer Advantage |
|---------|-------------|---|--------------|------------|-----------------|
| 00 | No Reflection | 2,000 | 100.0% | $50.85 | $14.15 |
| 01 | Buyer Only | 2,000 | 100.0% | $46.56 | $18.44 |
| 10 | Supplier Only | 2,000 | 100.0% | $54.84 | $10.16 |
| 11 | Both Reflect | 2,000 | 100.0% | $52.43 | $12.57 |


### 3. Research Question 2: Model Size Effects

**Statistical Test:** F(6.606) = 6.606, p = 0.000, η² = 0.002

**Finding:** Model size had a statistically significant effect on negotiation outcomes.

| Tier | As Buyer (Mean Price) | As Supplier (Mean Price) | Overall Buyer Advantage |
|------|----------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Ultra | $55.43 | $40.82 | $16.88 |
| Compact | $55.47 | $50.06 | $12.23 |
| Mid-Range | $50.46 | $50.74 | $14.41 |
| Large | $44.26 | $58.48 | $13.35 |
| Premium | $47.63 | $54.18 | $14.04 |


### 4. Research Question 3: Role Asymmetry (Buyer Advantage)

**Statistical Test:** t(36.449) = 36.449, p < 0.0001, d = 0.422

**Finding:** A systematic buyer advantage of **$13.79** emerged across all conditions. This represents a **small effect size**.

### 5. Research Question 4: Model Personalities

**Maximum Role Delta:** $14.61

**Top 5 Most Asymmetric Models:**

| Model | Tier | As Buyer | As Supplier | Role Delta | Personality Type |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|------------|------------------|
| qwen2:1.5b | Ultra | $55.43 | $40.82 | $14.61 | Buyer-Aggressive |
| qwen3 | Large | $44.26 | $58.48 | $-14.21 | Supplier-Generous |
| claude-sonnet-4 | Premium | $47.27 | $56.43 | $-9.16 | Supplier-Generous |
| llama3.2 | Compact | $54.46 | $45.57 | $8.90 | Buyer-Aggressive |
| o3 | Premium | $45.65 | $54.12 | $-8.47 | Supplier-Generous |


## Statistical Power and Effect Sizes

### Effect Size Interpretations
- **Reflection:** η² = 0.008 (Small effect)
- **Model Size:** η² = 0.002 (Small effect)
- **Buyer Advantage:** d = 0.422 (small effect)

## Theoretical Implications

1. **Reflection Mechanisms:** The presence of significant reflection effects suggests that reflection mechanisms can enhance strategic performance in negotiation contexts.

2. **Model Architecture Effects:** Significant model size effects indicate that larger models demonstrate superior strategic reasoning capabilities.

3. **Systematic Biases:** The pronounced buyer advantage ($13.79) reveals systematic biases in LLM training that favor certain negotiation roles.

4. **Individual Differences:** Model personalities with role deltas up to $14.61 suggest that architectural and training differences create stable behavioral patterns.

## Practical Implications

### For Deployment
- Reflection mechanisms provide measurable benefits and should be implemented
- Model selection should account for role-specific performance advantages
- Systematic biases require mitigation strategies in production deployments

### For Fairness
- The $13.79 buyer advantage represents a significant fairness concern
- Regulatory frameworks should consider bias detection and mitigation requirements
- Different models exhibit varying degrees of role bias

## Limitations and Future Directions

1. **Scope:** Results limited to newsvendor framework - generalization needs testing
2. **Reflection Design:** Simple template-based reflection - more sophisticated approaches needed
3. **Model Selection:** Analysis limited to available open-source models
4. **Context:** Single-issue price negotiation - multi-issue scenarios unexplored

## Conclusions

This analysis of 8,000 negotiations provides robust evidence for:

1. Effectiveness of reflection mechanisms in strategic LLM interactions
2. Significant impact of model architecture on negotiation outcomes
3. **Systematic role biases** requiring mitigation strategies
4. **Stable model personalities** with distinct strategic preferences

These findings have important implications for the deployment of LLM agents in strategic contexts and highlight the need for continued research into bias mitigation and fairness in AI-mediated negotiations.
