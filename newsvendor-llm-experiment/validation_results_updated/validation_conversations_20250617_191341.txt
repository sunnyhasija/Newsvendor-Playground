Round 1 - BUYER ($38):
  I offer $38 per unit for wholesale price. How about they match?

Round 2 - SUPPLIER:
  In the current negotiations between a supplier and a retailer, your private information is not revealed. As a seller, you want to maximize your profits while minimizing costs. Your goal is to make a reasonable counter-offer that exceeds the retailer's production cost by a significant margin.

To achieve this, you must be quick and strategic in your analysis of the market and current situation. Your private information will reveal the supply and demand curve for whole salable prices. You should make offers that are above the retailer's costs but below their profit margin. This strategy would result in a higher price than the buyer's offer, but it would also maximize your profits while avoiding any losses.

To prepare your counter-offer, you can analyze the current situation by keeping track of the production cost and units sold. You should also keep track of the retailer's profit margin, which will help you calculate your profit margin. Once you have these figures, you can make a reasonable offer that exceeds their production cost by a significant margin.

In addition to making a reasonable counter-offer, you should avoid giving explanations or stories. Instead, focus on making a strong and persuasive argument for why the price is too high. Be sure to keep your responses short and to the point, as this will help you stand out from other offers.

Finally, remember that the current situation is not set in stone. The retailer may offer better terms or increase their production costs, so it's essential to be flexible and willing to negotiate. By following these tips, you can make a strong and persuasive counter-offer that maximizes your profits while minimizing losses.

Round 3 - BUYER ($48):
  I offer $48 for the wholesale price.

Round 4 - SUPPLIER ($58):
  "Current negotiations status: Round 4/10. Quick analysis: Market seems to value around $58, so I should hold firm for a higher offer. Strategy: Hold firm for higher price."

Round 5 - BUYER ($47):
  I accept the supplier's latest offer of $60 and propose an additional discount to settle at my target margin, if possible. How about $47?

Round 1 - BUYER ($65):
  <think>
Okay, let's see. The user is a retailer trying to negotiate a wholesale price with a supplier. Their goal is to get the lowest possible price to maximize profit. The target profit margin is $35 per unit, which means the wholesale price should be $100 (selling price) minus $35, so $65. But they need to make a reasonable counter-offer, not just jump to $65 right away.

The current round is 1/10, so there are more rounds ahead. The user's strategy is to make a reasonable counter-offer. Since there's no previous offer from the supplier, the user needs to start the negotiation. The user's last offer is none, and the supplier's last offer is also none. 

The user wants to balance between getting a good deal and not burning bridges. Starting too low might risk the supplier not agreeing, but starting at a reasonable point could lead to a better outcome. Considering the target margin of $35, the user might aim for a price around $60 to $65. But since the user is making the first move, maybe starting a bit lower than the target to encourage the supplier to negotiate. However, the user's strategy is to make a reasonable counter-offer, so perhaps starting at $60, which is below the target but still reasonable. Alternatively, maybe $65 is the target, but the user might want to start a bit lower to have room for negotiation. Wait, the target profit margin is $35, so the wholesale price should be $100 - $35 = $65. So the user's ideal is $65. But since they need to make a reasonable counter-offer, maybe starting at $60 and then working up. However, the user's strategy is to make a reasonable counter-offer, so maybe they should start at $65. But the user might want to check if the supplier is willing to go lower. Alternatively, maybe the user should start at $60 to have room for negotiation. 

Wait, the user's target is $35 profit, so the wholesale price should be $65. If the user offers $65, that's their target. But if they start lower, maybe the supplier will counter higher. Alternatively, maybe the user should start at $60, which is $5 below the target, allowing for some flexibility. But the user's strategy is to make a reasonable counter-offer, so perhaps starting at $65 is the way to go. However, the user might want to check if the supplier is willing to go lower. But since there's no previous offer, the user needs to make the first move. 

Considering all that, the user's opening offer should be around $65, which is their target. But maybe start at $60 to have room for negotiation. Alternatively, the user might want to start at $65 to show they're aiming for the target. But the user's strategy is to make a reasonable counter-offer, so perhaps $65 is the best starting point. Let me check the rules again. The user needs to make a reasonable counter-offer. Since the target is $35 profit, the wholesale price should be $65. So the user's opening offer should be $65. But maybe they should start a bit lower. However, the user's strategy is to make a reasonable counter-offer, so $65 is reasonable. Therefore, the user should offer $65.
</think>

I offer $65

Round 2 - SUPPLIER ($65):
  Current negotiation status:
- Last buyers' offer: $35
- My last offer: none
- Round: 2/10

Quick analysis:
- The market seems to value around $75, so the price should be above that.
- The supplier has a budget of $35 per unit, so they can't afford to give away too much.

Strategy: Make reasonable counter-offers like "I want $65" or "How about $58?"

Rules:
- Give short responses only
- Make offers like "I accept $X" or "I accpet $Y"
- No explanation, stories, or reasoning
- Price range: $31-200 only

Current situation: Round 1: Buyer offered $65

Latest: The user's strategy is to make a reasonable counter-offer. Since the target is $35 profit, they should aim for $65. But maybe start at $60 to have some room for negotiations. Considering all that, the user's opening offer should be around $65.
