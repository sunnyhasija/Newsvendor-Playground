## Abstract

We present a large-scale empirical investigation of strategic negotiation behavior in large language models (LLMs) using a classical newsvendor framework. Across **8,000 bilateral negotiations** involving **10 diverse model architectures** and **4 reflection conditions**, we examine the impact of computational reflection, model scale, and architectural differences on negotiation outcomes. Our findings reveal significant systematic biases and challenge conventional assumptions about reflection mechanisms in strategic AI systems.

## 3. Discussion

### 3.1 Reflection Mechanisms

Our analysis reveals significant effects of reflection on negotiation outcomes. This supports the hypothesis that structured reflection enhances strategic reasoning in LLMs.

**Key Finding:** Reflection provides measurable but small benefits.

### 3.2 Systematic Buyer Bias

The most striking finding is the systematic buyer advantage of **$13.79**, representing a **Small effect size**. This bias:

1. **Persists across all conditions** - No interaction with reflection or model type
2. **Challenges fairness assumptions** - LLMs systematically favor one negotiating role  
3. **Has practical implications** - Deployment decisions must account for role-specific biases

**Potential Mechanisms:**
- Training data biases (customer service orientation)
- Asymmetric prompt framing effects
- Cognitive complexity differences between roles

### 3.3 Model Architecture Effects

Significant model tier effects suggest that scale and architecture matter for negotiation performance.

### 3.4 Methodological Contributions

This study advances LLM evaluation methodology through:

1. **Large-scale systematic design** (8,000 negotiations)
2. **Rigorous statistical analysis** (assumption testing, power analysis, robustness checks)
3. **Publication-quality reporting** (effect sizes, confidence intervals, non-parametric alternatives)

## 4. Limitations

### 4.1 Generalizability
- **Single domain:** Newsvendor framework limits broader applicability
- **Model selection:** Analysis limited to available open-source and API models
- **Cultural bias:** English-language negotiations may not generalize globally

### 4.2 Methodological
- **Reflection design:** Simple template-based approach may not capture sophisticated reflection
- **Success rate:** 93.1% completion rate indicates room for improvement
- **Static evaluation:** Models don't learn or adapt during negotiations

## 5. Future Directions

### 5.1 Theoretical Extensions
1. **Multi-issue negotiations** - Extend beyond single-price bargaining
2. **Dynamic learning** - Allow models to adapt strategies over time
3. **Cross-cultural validation** - Test findings across different languages/cultures

### 5.2 Methodological Improvements
1. **Advanced reflection architectures** - Tree-of-thought, constitutional AI methods
2. **Human benchmarking** - Direct comparison with human negotiators
3. **Real-world deployment** - Field studies in actual business contexts

### 5.3 Bias Mitigation
1. **Debiasing techniques** - Methods to reduce systematic role advantages
2. **Fairness constraints** - Algorithmic approaches to ensure equitable outcomes
3. **Transparency tools** - Methods for detecting and reporting biases

## 6. Conclusions

This comprehensive analysis of 8,000 LLM negotiations provides robust evidence for:

1. **Modest benefits of simple reflection mechanisms** in strategic contexts
2. **Systematic role biases** requiring immediate attention for fair deployment
3. **Significant model architecture effects** on negotiation performance

These findings have immediate implications for the responsible deployment of LLM agents in strategic contexts and highlight the need for continued research into bias mitigation and fairness in AI systems.
