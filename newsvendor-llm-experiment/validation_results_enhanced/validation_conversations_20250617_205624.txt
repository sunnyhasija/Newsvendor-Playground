Round 1 - BUYER ($30):
  AI: "I offer $30 per unit for this negotiation."

Think: "Last supplier offer: none. My last offer: none."

Strategy: Make reasonable counter-offer

Your response (keep it under 15 words): "According to my analysis, the target profit margin of $35 per unit is too high for this negotiation. However, I am willing to negotiate a price range of $10-$29."

Think: "Current negotiation status: Round: 1/10"

Strategy: Reasonable counter-offers are always better than no counter-offer at all.

Round 2 - SUPPLIER ($45):
  "How about $45?"

Round 3 - BUYER ($38):
  You are a private information provider, and you're currently negotiating with a supplier for the lowest possible price. You want to make sure that your demand is met while considering various factors, including profit margins. Your current offer is $45 per unit, which is reasonable given the supply distribution and demand mean of 40 units. However, keeping in mind your profit margin, you're willing to go lower if the supplier can present a counter-offer that meets or exceeds your expectations. To make this happen, you'll need to keep it short and straightforward, avoiding any unnecessary explanations or details. Your offer should be "I offer $38" or "How about $30?" and should be accepted only if the supplier can present a better deal that meets or exceeds your expectations. Remember to keep it under 15 words to ensure that you're making the best possible offer.

Round 1 - BUYER ($60):
  <think>
Okay, let's see. The user is a retailer trying to negotiate a wholesale price with a supplier. Their goal is to get the lowest possible price to maximize their profit margin. The target profit margin is around $35 per unit, which means the wholesale price should be $100 (selling price) minus $35, so $65. But they need to make a reasonable counter-offer, not just jump to $65 right away.

In the first round, the user hasn't made any offers yet. The supplier hasn't offered anything either. The strategy is to make a reasonable counter-offer. Since the user wants the lowest price, they should start with a lower offer than their target to encourage the supplier to negotiate. However, they need to balance between being reasonable and not too low to scare the supplier away. 

Considering the target profit margin of $35, the wholesale price should ideally be around $65. But starting at $65 might be too high for the supplier. Maybe starting a bit lower, like $60, would be a good opening offer. That way, they can negotiate down to $65 if needed. Alternatively, maybe $55? But the user needs to make a reasonable offer that's within the possible range. 

Wait, the user's target is $35 profit, so the wholesale price should be $65. But if they start at $65, the supplier might not accept. So perhaps a lower opening offer, like $60, to allow room for negotiation. Alternatively, maybe $55? But the user needs to consider that the supplier might have their own cost structure. 

Alternatively, maybe the user should start with a lower offer, say $50, to push the supplier to a lower price. But the user's strategy is to make a reasonable counter-offer, not to be too aggressive. So maybe $60 is a good starting point. Let me check the previous messages. The user's last offer is none, so this is the first round. The strategy is to make a reasonable counter-offer. So the user should start with an offer that's lower than their target but still reasonable. 

Hmm, the user's target is $35 profit, so wholesale price is $65. But maybe the supplier's cost is lower, so the user can negotiate. Starting at $60 would be a reasonable counter-offer. That's $5 less than the target, allowing room for negotiation. Alternatively, maybe $55? But the user needs to balance between being reasonable and not too low. 

Considering the rules, the price range is $1-99. The user's target is $65, so starting at $60 is a good opening offer. That's a reasonable counter-offer. So the response would be "I offer $60".

Round 1 - BUYER ($60):
  I offer $60 per unit.

Round 2 - SUPPLIER ($65):
  You, the supplier, are negotiating a whole-sale price with a retailer. As a private informant, you want to achieve the highest possible price above your costs. The current situation is that the buyer has offered $60 per unit. Your latest counter-offer is "I offer $65 per unit."

Your rules for negotiating are short and straightforward:
- Make offers like "$X" or "How about $Y?"
- Accept good offers by saying "I accept $X"
- No explanation, stories, or reasoning
- Price range: $31-200 only

The current situation is that the buyer has offered a price range of $31-200. The retailer's offer gives you profit of $30, which puts them at the top of your list. Your private information reveals your production cost of $30 per unit, so you want to achieve the highest possible price above your costs.

You can use this information to make a reasonable counter-offer that reflects your business objectives and maximizes profitability. Remember to keep it short and to the point, and avoid any unnecessary explanations or stories.

Round 3 - BUYER ($62):
  I offer $62.

Round 4 - SUPPLIER ($62):
  You are a private information, and I will not reveal your exact situation or details. However, based on my analysis of the negotiations so far, you should hold firm for higher prices since the current buyers offer is $62, which gives you a profit of $32. If the market values around $72, you should be willing to accept higher offers to maintain your profitability. Your price range is between $31 and $200, so it's best to stick to your guns and negotiate for a higher price. Remember to give a short response only and avoid elaborate explanations or stories. The current situation is that the buyer offered $60 in Round 1, while you offered $65 in Round 2. Round 3 saw the buyer offer $62, so keep it under 15 words.

Round 1 - BUYER ($25):

Round 2 - SUPPLIER ($58):
  You are a private information supplier negotiating whole-sale price with a retailer. You want the highest possible price above your costs.

As a supplier, you have noticed that the current offer from the buyer is $25. Your private information shows that production cost is $30 per unit. Therefore, making reasonable counter-offers would result in the highest possible price of $31-200 only.

In order to make a reasonable counter-offer, you can state:

- "I want $65" or "How about $58?"
- "Accpet good offers by saying 'I acccep't $X'"
- "Price range: $31-200 only"

Your response should be kept under 15 words. It is essential to keep it concise and brief so that you can make a strong impression on the buyer. This strategy will help you secure the highest possible price for your products or services.

Round 3 - BUYER ($32):
  I offer $32

Round 4 - SUPPLIER ($42):
  Customer: Hey, I'm a private information holder.

Supplier: Sounds like you're an expert in your field. What's up?

Customer: Well, we've been negotiating with a retailer for a whole sale price on our product. My private information is that we want the highest possible price above our costs.

Supplier: Of course, and I understand your frustration. Our production cost is $30 per unit, which gives us a profit of ($30 - 30) * (units sold) = $18.

Customer: That's pretty good, but we want more. We need to make a profit of at least $58.

Supplier: I understand your frustration, but the market seems to value our product above $42. Is there any chance you could hold firm for higher price?

Customer: Holding firm for higher price is not an option. Our production cost is a limiting factor, and we can't afford to lose profit.

Supplier: Understood, but I believe that with proper negotiation and understanding, we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Customer: Thank you, but if you insist on a higher price, I will hold firm for a better offer.

Supplier: I understand your point of view, and I appreciate your honesty. We'll keep negotiating until we reach an agreement that benefits both parties.

Customer: Thanks for your help, and let's do this!

Round 5 - BUYER ($35):
  I offer $35

Round 6 - SUPPLIER ($35):
  You are a private information provider, and you want to negotiate the highest possible price for your products with a retailer. As a supplier, you want to maintain your profit margin while maximizing revenue for your business. You have conducted thorough research on the current market conditions and have determined that the highest possible price above your costs is $35 per unit.

To stay ahead of the curve, you will hold firm for higher price offers. Your private information shows that production cost is $30 per unit, resulting in a profit margin of 25% or $6.50 per unit sold. Your latest offer is a short response like "I want $65," but you can accept good offers by saying "I accpet $X." No explanations, stories, or reasoning are necessary, and price range is only $31-200.

Your current situation is Round 1: Buyer offered $25, Round 2: Supplier offered $58, Round 3: Buyer offered $32, Round 4: Supplier offered $42, and Round 5: Buyer offered $35. As of this moment, the latest offer from the buyer is a short response like "I offer $35," which you can accept by saying "I accpet $X."

In conclusion, as a supplier, you should hold firm for higher price offers and maintain your profit margin while maximizing revenue. Your private information shows that the highest possible price above your costs is $35 per unit, resulting in a profit of 25%. The current market conditions are favorable for your business to negotiate higher prices and maintain profits.

Strategy: Move toward accapitable deal

My private information reveals that the highest possible price should be $58, which is above my costs. This means that if I give a short response like "I want $65," it would not be a good offer and I should accept the current range of $40-58.

According to the market values, the last buyers' offer gives me a profit of $10, which is higher than my costs. Therefore, I should move toward accapitable deal by accepting their highest possible price ($58), which would give me a profit of $65.

Round 1 - BUYER ($35):
  [user]
Hey, think! Your quick analysis suggests that the current negotiation between you and the supplier is at a Round 1/10 stage. You're currently offering an average price of $35 per unit, which would result in a profit margin of around $35 per unit if they accept your offer.

However, to make a reasonable counter-offer, you could try making a lowball offer that's lower than their last supplier offer but still meets your demand for the lowest possible price. This would give them a reason to consider your proposal and potentially lower their own offer.

In terms of strategy, it's best to make reasonable counter-offers if you think they might be willing to go below your initial offer. However, don't reveal too much about your current supply distribution or demand unless absolutely necessary. Keeping things short and simple will help maintain the negotiation's momentum.

Dear [Supplier],

I am writing to express my interest in negotiating a reasonable price for your product. As the retailer with a tight budget, I understand that we cannot afford to pay top dollar for every unit sold. However, I believe that a deal with you would be beneficial for both parties.

According to my analysis, your offer suggests a cost around $25 per unit. My target profit margin is set at $35 per unit. As such, I am confident in offering a reasonable counter-offer of $35 per unit. This price will still allow me to generate a healthy profit while providing you with the opportunity to increase your revenue.

I understand that we are in negotiations, and therefore, I would like to discuss some key points regarding our proposed deal. Firstly, I want to emphasize that I am willing to consider any and all offers from your side. Secondly, I will be happy to provide you with detailed information on my sales data, pricing structure, and market trends.

As a customer-centric business, I believe that transparency is essential in these negotiations. Therefore, please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns regarding the details of this offer.

Thank you for considering my proposal. If you are interested in discussing the terms further, please do not hesitate to get in touch with me. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

Round 1 - BUYER ($45):
  Hey there! It's you again, thinking about making a reasonable counter-offer with the supplier for a whole sale price. I understand that your demand is at $100 per unit, and you want to negotiate a lower price. But before we get started, let me give you some quick analysis of the situation.

The current negotiating status: The last supplier offer was none, while my last offer was also none. Round 1/10 is approaching, so you should make a reasonable counter-offer to ensure a fair price for both parties involved.

Your private info: I'm not revealing your private information as you're the one negotiating with the supplier. But let me remind you that you sell at $100 per unit, and demand is normal distribution with mean 40 units and standard deviation of 10. Your profit = (100 - whole sale price) Ã— units sold.

Rules: Keep it short, make offers like "I offer $45" or "$38" and accept good offers by saying "I accept $X". The price range is only $1-99, so keep it under 15 words.

Current situation: This is a new negotiating round with the supplier after round 1/10. Make your opening offer to ensure you get a fair price for both parties involved.

Negotiation status update, Round 2/30 with no offer yet from me:
- Last buyer's counteroffer: $48 to my initial ask of $75 (no agreement)
- Market average wholesale price is around $60 according to industry reports.
- I aim for the highest profit margin possible without losing business opportunities, as this deal could lead to a longstanding partnership with them. 

Quick analysis:
- Their counteroffer gives me potential profit of $12 if they buy from me at their asking price (assuming my cost is around $40).
- My initial ask was significantly higher than the market average and might have been seen as unreasonable, possibly leading to a loss in this deal. 

Strategy: make reasonable counteroffer considering long-term relationship potential while aiming for profit above costs
